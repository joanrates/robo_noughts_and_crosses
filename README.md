# robo_noughts_and_crosses
This project is the implementation of a noughts and crosses game made to play just pointing with the hand with a robot. It uses mdiapipe to analize the hand movments and cv2 to use the camera. It's designed to work with an elephant robotic's robot but it's very easily customizable
